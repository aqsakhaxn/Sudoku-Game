# Sudoku-Game
Sudoku game in Python with a graphical user interface using PyQt5
Graphical User Interface: Implement a user-friendly interface to display the Sudoku board and allow users to interact with the game.

Random Puzzle Generation: Generate Sudoku puzzles randomly with varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) by initializing the board with a solution and removing a specific number of cells based on the chosen difficulty level.

Input Validation: Implement a mechanism to validate user input by checking the entered numbers against the Sudoku rules to ensure correctness and prevent invalid moves.

Hint System: Include a hint feature that aids the player by revealing the correct number for a randomly chosen empty cell. Limit the number of hints available to the player.

Game Completion Detection: Detect when the player successfully completes the Sudoku puzzle by filling in all the cells correctly. Display a congratulatory message along with the elapsed time taken to solve the puzzle.

Game Over: Implement a game over condition when the player exceeds the maximum allowed number of invalid moves. Display a message indicating that the player has made too many invalid moves.
